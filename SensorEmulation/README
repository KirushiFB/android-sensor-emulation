For using with a real paired device, its ip-address needs to be
put in the ~/dev_ip_port.conf of the host. The loop delay in
sensors_emu.c under hardware/libsensors_emu for the accelerometer
server thread needs to be 100ns. And the poll delay in dummy_poll()
needs to be 1000us.

For using with remote server, the remote server's ip-address needs
to be in ~/remote_server_ip_port.conf of the host. The loop
delay in sensors_emu.c under the already said above path, for
the accelerometer server has to be 1000ns. And the poll delay in
dummy_poll() needs to be 80000us.

Qemu with Android-x86 has to be launched with the following command
to enable port-mapping from the host to guest with the necessary
changes for the image name, etc

sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -vga qxl -spice port=5930,
disable-ticketing -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::4444-:5555,
hostfwd=tcp::5000-:5000,hostfwd=tcp::5001-:5001,
hostfwd=tcp::5002-:5002,hostfwd=tcp::5003-:5003,
hostfwd=tcp::5004-:5004,hostfwd=tcp::5005-:5005,hostfwd=tcp::5006-:5006,
hostfwd=tcp::5007-:5007,hostfwd=tcp::5008-:5008,hostfwd=tcp::5009-:5009 
-net nic,model=pcnet -net tap -hda android-x86-jelly-bean.img

Then launch spice in a separate window to get the Android-x86 UI.

If there is a conflict of ports while launching Qemu, then make sure you
the ports aren't already in use. There may be previously launched instances
of Qemu runnning using those ports. The userspace "C" programs -
SensorEmulationClientServer.c and SensorEmulationRemoteServer.c might
be using those ports as well. So, make sure you launch Qemu to run
Android-x86 first followed by the userspace "C" program always to avoid
port-in-use problems. This is a side-effect of port-mapping usage and
not really a issue.
